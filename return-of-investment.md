# R.O.I. - Return of Investment

Essentially, ROI is a _"a metric that gives you a numerical representation of the return you can get by embedding an
automation strategy into your QA workflows."_ - Relevant Software.

By calculating ROI, you can find helpful ways to:

- Determine the financial impact (positive/negative) that test automation brings to your business
- Estimate the payoff of an investment into test automation
- Gives a clear idea of the gains and losses associated with test automation
- Empowers your business (time to market) in front of investors to encourage them further

As a general rule, ROI can be simply put as a result of the following formula:

> Subtracting the estimated costs from the benefits, dividing the result by the expenses, and multiplied by 100

### Benefits

These are some of the benefits that can be measured from ROI results: 

- Savings resulting from automation
- Reduced risks (financial) from automation usage
- Time saved by automation tasks versus manual execution efforts
- Money saved from manual efforts and capacity (salaries/compensation/hours)

In another hand, costs can be measured as: 

- Money spent on adopting automation
- Time needed to develop and setup test automation practices (including framework and tooling)
- Expenses associated with maintaining and supporting TAF tooling, results, and issues

## Elements of ROI Calculation

### Cost

Probably one of the main reasons why ROI becomes so important and costs itself a critical element while calculating it.
The cost benefit might not show immediately due to the need to boostrap framework, setup processes, establish workflows.
However, it definitely shows the downward slope in a long run.

### Time

Time plays a significant role in ROI calculation especially when looked from the angle of a more experienced engineer
(or testers). Whenever writing test cases and executing them manually, there is a huge chunk of time spent in manual 
activities and therefore a huge loss of their capacity. The more redundant the task is, the less time they have to 
dedicate to essential operations and to deliver value. 

### Quality

Providing an error-free operation and guaranteeing a zero human error factor to the picture, quality is definitely one
if the main metrics in place. Test automation boosts and increases significantly quality of products over time and leads
to improved customer satisfaction ultimately.

## How to Improve ROI in Test Automation

Here are few tips/topics that if - well addressed - can play a major factor in improving ROI results: 

- Decide what should be Automated
- Created Testable Products
- Use standard/well known and proof TAFs and Tools
- Prepare Re-usable Test Cases
- Prioritize the Right Tasks

## ROI Calculation

### Basic 

The very basic formula to calculate ROI is to **deduct benefits from costs, divide them by costs, and multiply by 100**.

### Efficiency of ROI

Considered a more advanced approach, the efficiency in ROI can be calculated by focusing on different points:

- **Automated TC Development** = (Hourly automation time per test * Number of automated test cases) / 8
- **Automated TC Execution** = (Automated test execution time per test * Number of automated test cases * Period of ROI) / 18
- **Automated TC Analysis**  = (Test Analysis time * Period of ROI) / 8
- **Automated TC Maintenance** = (Maintenance time * Period of ROI) / 8
- **Manual Execution** = (Manual test execution time * Number of manual test cases * Period of ROI) / 8

- _**Note:**_ the Period of ROI refers to the time period for what the ROI is calculated.
